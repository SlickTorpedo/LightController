# Voice-Controlled Lights

This is a small project I made in a day that allows me to control my lights with my voice. My bed is on the opposite side of the room from my lights, and I hate getting into bed, deciding I'm tired and going to sleep, but then having to get out of bed to turn the lights off. 

## Overview

I created this project so that I can use my Alexa to control my lights. It also technically works using voice2json, but it has too many issues. Alexa has better voice recognition anyways, so I just use Alexa instead.

## Features

- Voice control of lights using Alexa
- Basic integration with voice2json (not supported, may require tweaks)

## Setup

1. Ensure you have an Alexa device set up and connected to your home network.
2. Follow the instructions to integrate your lights with Alexa.
3. Optionally, you can try setting up voice2json, but be aware it is not supported and may require some tweaks to get it working.

## Usage

Simply use voice commands with your Alexa device to turn your lights on or off. For example:
- "Alexa, ask Cosmos Controller to turn off the lights" (All Lights)
- "Alexa, ask Cosmos Controller to turn on the lights"
- "Alexa, ask Cosmos Controller to turn on the left light" (My Light)
- "Alexa, ask Cosmos Controller to turn on the right light" (My Roommate's Light)
- "Alexa, ask Cosmos Controller to turn off the left light"
- "Alexa, ask Cosmos Controller to turn off the right light"

## Limitations

- The voice2json integration is not supported and may require tweaks to work.
- Alexa provides a much better voice recognition experience.

## Note

This is me posting the project to contribute to my profile. You will probably have to tweak the 3D files and code if you want it to work on your own lights, but it's a nice starting point.
