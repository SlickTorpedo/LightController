# Alexa Skill Files

This repository contains the necessary files for setting up your Alexa skill. You can access the [Amazon Alexa Developer Console here](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).

### Important Notes:
- This skill is built using a slightly modified template provided by Amazon. I don't have a lot of experience with Alexa skills, so my focus was just to get it working. I haven't spent time refining the code or removing any unnecessary bloat.
- **Configuration Required**: 
  - In the `lambda_function.py` file, you will need to change the URL and authentication token on **line 64** to match your specific setup.
